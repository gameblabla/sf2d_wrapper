- In sf2d, you can get the size of the texture in its structure. (For example, texture->w) This isn't supported by SDL2 however
I guess the only to do that is to make a custom struct for sf2d textures instead and hold the SDL2's texture inside the structure.

- Support for tiled textures, rotated rectangles, Circle Pad support, loading C-arrays images...

- Make it so you can change the text size if it changed.
